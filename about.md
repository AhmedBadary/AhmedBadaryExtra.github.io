# Hello, my name is Ahmad Badary!
<p class="message">
  Hey there! Here you will know more about me.
</p>
I am Ahmad Thabet Badary. I have attended UC Berkeley from Fall 2014 to Fall 2017 pursuing three degrees in Theoretical Physics, Applied Mathematics (Statstical Learning Focus), and Computer Science. I have, also, attended MIT, briefly, during Spring 2015.

As a young child, I was able to finish all of high-schools' content by the age of 12 and graduate. I, then, started focusing on Theoretical Physics and Pure Mathematics.

I am really interested in theory. I have been a theoretician my whole life focusing primarily on theoretical physics beyond the standard model, and perturbation theory and PDE's.

My focus, however, has shifted significantly. As of now, I would consider my main research focus to be "Statistical Learning Theory". I focus, primairly, on the intersection between Mathematics and statistical learning regimes like Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

On this website you'll find my notes on some topics relating to the mixture of interests that I have (mentioned above) and a showcase of my projects. You'll, also, find some of my rants on certain topics and my own perspectives.

Updated Soon!
