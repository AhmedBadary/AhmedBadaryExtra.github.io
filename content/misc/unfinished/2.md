__Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning (binary classification):__{: style="color: red"}  
Let $$\mathcal{H}$$ be a hypothesis class of functions from a domain $$X$$ to $$\{0,1\}$$ and let the loss function be the $$0-1$$ loss.  
The following are equivalent:  
$$\begin{array}{l}{\text { 1. } \mathcal{H} \text { has uniform convergence. }} \\ {\text { 2. The ERM is a PAC learning algorithm for } \mathcal{H} \text { . }} \\ {\text { 3. } \mathcal{H} \text { is } PAC \text { learnable. }} \\ {\text { 4. } \mathcal{H} \text { has finite } VC \text { dimension. }}\end{array}$$  
This can be extended to __regression__ and __multiclass classification__.

    It is a measure of the __computational resources__ needed to *__specify__* the object.

    [__MML__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_message_length) is a formal Information Theory restatement of __Occam's Razor__: even when models are equal in goodness of fit accuracy to the observed data, the one generating the <span>shortest overall message</span>{: style="color: purple"} is more likely to be correct (where the message consists of a statement of the model, followed by a statement of data encoded concisely using that model).

## Statistical Learning Theory

1. **Statistical Learning Theory:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    __Statistical Learning Theory__ is a framework for machine learning drawing from the fields of statistics and functional analysis. Under certain assumptions, this framework allows us to study the question:  
    > __How can we affect performance on the test set when we can only observe the training set?__{: style="color: blue"}  

    It is a _statistical_ approach to __Computational Learning Theory__.  

2. **Formal Definition:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    Let:  
    * $$X$$: the vector space of all possible __inputs__  
    * $$Y$$: the vector space of all possible __outputs__  
    * $$Z = X \times Y$$: the __product space__ of (input,output) pairs  
    * $$n$$: the number of __samples__ in the __training set__  
    * $$S=\left\{\left(\vec{x}_{1}, y_{1}\right), \ldots,\left(\vec{x}_{n}, y_{n}\right)\right\}=\left\{\vec{z}_{1}, \ldots, \vec{z}_{n}\right\}$$: the __training set__  
    * $$\mathcal{H} = f : X \rightarrow Y$$: the __hypothesis space__ of all functions  
    * $$V(f(\vec{x}), y)$$: an __error/loss function__  

    __Assumptions:__  
    * The training and test data are generated by an *__unknown, joint__* __probability distribution over datasets__ (over the product space $$Z$$, denoted: $$p_{\text{data}}(z)=p(\vec{x}, y)$$) called the __data-generating process__.  
        * $$p_{\text{data}}$$ is a __joint distribution__ so that it allows us to model _uncertainty in predictions_ (e.g. from noise in data) because $$y$$ is not a deterministic function of $$\vec{x}$$, but rather a _random variable_ with __conditional distribution__ $$p(y \vert \vec{x})$$ for a fixed $$\vec{x}$$.  
    * The __i.i.d. assumptions:__  
        * The examples in each dataset are __independent__ from each other  
        * The _training set_ and _test set_ are __identically distributed__ (drawn from the same probability distribution as each other)  

        > A collection of random variables is __independent and identically distributed__ if each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent.  
        > _Informally,_ it says that all the variables provide the same kind of information independently of each other.  
        > * [Discussion on the importance if i.i.d assumptions](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/213464/on-the-importance-of-the-i-i-d-assumption-in-statistical-learning/214220)  


    __The Inference Problem__{: style="color: red"}    
    Finding a function $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ such that $$f(\vec{x}) \sim y$$.  

    __The Expected Risk:__  
    <p>$$I[f]=\mathbf{E}[V(f(\vec{x}), y)]=\int_{X \times Y} V(f(\vec{x}), y) p(\vec{x}, y) d \vec{x} d y$$</p>  

    __The Target Function:__  
    is the best possible function $$f$$ that can be chosen, is given by:  
    <p>$$f=\inf_{h \in \mathcal{H}} I[h]$$</p>  

    __The Empirical Risk:__  
    Is a *__proxy measure__* for the __expected risk__, based on the training set.  
    It is necessary because the probability distribution $$p(\vec{x}, y)$$ is _unknown_.  
    <p>$$I_{S}[f]=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} V\left(f\left(\vec{x}_{i}\right), y_{i}\right)$$</p>  

3. **Empirical risk minimization:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    __Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)__ is a principle in _statistical learning theory_ that is based on approximating the __Generalization Error (True Risk)__ by measuring the __Training Error (Empirical Risk)__, i.e. the performance on training data.  

    A _learning algorithm_ that chooses the function $$f_{S}$$ that minimizes the _empirical risk_ is called __empirical risk minimization__:  
    <p>$$R_{\mathrm{emp}}(h) = I_{S}[f]=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} V\left(f\left(\vec{x}_{i}\right), y_{i}\right)$$</p>    
    <p>$$f_{S} = \hat{h} = \arg \min _{h \in \mathcal{H}} R_{\mathrm{emp}}(h)$$</p>

4. **Definitions:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    * __Generalization Error:__{: style="color: red"}  
        AKA: __Expected Risk/Error__, __Out-of-Sample Error__[^2], __$$E_{\text{out}}$$__   
        It is a measure of how accurately an algorithm is able to predict outcome values for previously unseen data.  
    * __Generalization Gap:__{: style="color: red"}  
        It is a measure of how accurately an algorithm is able to predict outcome values for previously unseen data.  

        __Formally:__  
        The generalization gap is the __difference between the expected and empirical error__:  
        <p>$$G =I\left[f_{n}\right]-I_{S}\left[f_{n}\right]$$</p>  

        An Algorithm is said to __Generalize__ (achieve __Generalization__) if:  
        <p>$$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} G_n = \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} I\left[f_{n}\right]-I_{S}\left[f_{n}\right]=0$$</p>  
        Equivalently:  
        <p>$$E_{\text { out }}(g) \approx E_{\text { in }}(g)$$</p>  
        or 
        <p>$$I\left[f_{n}\right] \approx I_{S}\left[f_{n}\right]$$</p>  

        __Computing the Generalization Gap:__  
        Since $$I\left[f_{n}\right]$$ cannot be computed for an unknown distribution, the generalization gap __cannot be computed__ either.  
        Instead the goal of __statistical learning theory__ is to _bound_ or _characterize_ the generalization gap in probability:  
        <p>$$P_{G}=P\left(I\left[f_{n}\right]-I_{S}\left[f_{n}\right] \leq \epsilon\right) \geq 1-\delta_{n}$$</p>  
        That is, the goal is to characterize the probability $${\displaystyle 1-\delta _{n}}$$ that the generalization gap is less than some error bound $${\displaystyle \epsilon }$$ (known as the __learning rate__ and generally dependent on $${\displaystyle \delta }$$ and $${\displaystyle n}$$).  
    * __The Empirical Distribution:__{: style="color: red"}  
        _AKA **Data-Generating Distribution**_  
        is the __discrete__ uniform distribution over the _sample points_.   
    * __The Approximation-Generalization Tradeoff:__{: style="color: red"}  
        * __Goal__:  
            Small $$E_{\text{out}}$$: Good approximation of $$f$$ *__out of sample__* (not in-sample).  
        * The tradeoff is characterized by the __complexity__ of the __hypothesis space $$\mathcal{H}$$__:  
            * __More Complex $$\mathcal{H}$$__: Better chance of approximating $$f$$  
            * __Less Complex $$\mathcal{H}$$__: Better chance of generalizing out-of-sample

            * This is what we minimize
        * __Test-Error__ is an *__approximation__* to the __Generalization Error/Expected Risk__ 
            * This is what we (can) compute to ensure that minimizing Training-Err/Empirical-Risk (ERM) also minimized the Generalization-Err/Expected-Risk (which we can't compute directly)  
    * __Why the goal is NOT to minimize $$E_{\text{in}}$$ completely (intuition)__:  
        Basically, if you have noise in the data; then fitting the (finite) training-data completely; i.e. minimizing the in-sample-err completely will underestimate the out-of-sample-err.  
        Since, if noise existed AND you fit training-data completely $$E_{\text{in}} = 0$$ THEN you inherently have fitted the noise AND your performance on out-sample will be lower.

## The Bias-Variance Decomposition Theory

11. **The Bias-Variance Decomposition Theory:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    __The Bias-Variance Decomposition Theory__ is a way to quantify the __Approximation-Generalization Tradeoff__.  

    __Assumptions:__  
    * The analysis is done over the __entire data-distribution__  
    * The target function $$f$$ is already __known__; and you're trying to answer the question:  
        "How can $$\mathcal{H}$$ approximate $$f$$ over all? not just on your sample."  
    * Applies to __real-valued targets__ (can be extended)  
    * Use __Square Error__ (can be extended)  

1. **The Bias-Variance Decomposition:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    The __Bias-Variance Decomposition__ is a way of analyzing a learning algorithm's *__expected out-of-sample error__*[^1] as a _sum of three terms:_  
    * __Bias:__ is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm.  
    * __Variance:__ is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set.  
    * __Irreducible Error__ (resulting from noise in the problem itself)  

    Equivalently, __Bias__ and __Variance__ measure _two different sources of errors in an estimator:_   
    * __Bias:__ measures the expected deviation from the true value of the function or parameter.  
        > AKA: __Approximation Error__[^3]  (statistics)  How well can $$\mathcal{H}$$ approximate the target function '$$f$$'  
    * __Variance:__ measures the deviation from the expected estimator value that any particular sampling of the data is likely to cause.  
        > AKA: __Estimation (Generalization) Error__ (statistics) How well we can zoom in on a good $$h \in \mathcal{H}$$  


    __Bias-Variance Decomposition Formula:__  
    For any function $$\hat{f} = g^{\mathcal{D}}$$ we select, we can decompose its *__expected (out-of-sample) error__* on an _unseen sample $$x$$_ as:  
    <p>$$\mathrm{E}\left[(y-\hat{f}(x))^{2}\right]=(\operatorname{Bias}[\hat{f}(x)])^{2}+\operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}(x)]+\sigma^{2}$$</p>  
    Where:  
    * __Bias__:  
        <p>$$\operatorname{Bias}[\hat{f}(x)]=\mathrm{E}[\hat{f}(x)]-f(x)$$</p>  
    * __Variance__:  
        <p>$$\operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}(x)]=\mathrm{E}\left[\hat{f}(x)^{2}\right]-\mathrm{E}[\hat{f}(x)]^{2}$$</p>  
    and the expectation ranges over different realizations of the training set $$\mathcal{D}$$.  

2. **The Bias-Variance Tradeoff:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    is the property of a set of predictive models whereby, models with a _lower bias_ (in parameter estimation) have a _higher variance_ (of the parameter estimates across samples) and vice-versa.  

    __Effects of Bias:__{: style="color: black"}  
    * __High Bias__: simple models, lead to *__underfitting__*{: style="color: red"}.  
    * __Low Bias__: complex models, lead to *__overfitting__*{: style="color: red"}.  
    
    __Effects of Variance:__{: style="color: black"}  
    * __High Variance__: complex models, lead to *__overfitting__*{: style="color: red"}.

    <strong style="color: red">The data resources you have is, "what do you have in order to navigate the hypothesis set?". Let's pick a hypothesis set that we can afford to navigate. That is the game in learning. Done with the bias and variance.</strong></p>


5. **Measuring the Bias and Variance:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    * __Training Error__: reflects Bias, NOT variance
    * __Test Error__: reflects Both


6. **Reducing the Bias and Variance, and Irreducible Err:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    * __Adding Good Feature__:  
        * Decrease Bias  
    * __Adding Bad Feature__:  
        * Doesn't affect (increase) Bias much  
    * __Adding ANY Feature__:  
        * Increases Variance  
    * __Adding more Data__:  
        * Decreases Variance
        * (May) Decreases Bias: if $$h$$ can fit $$f$$ exactly.  
    * __Noise in Test Set__:  
        * Affects ONLY Irreducible Err
    * __Noise in Training Set__:  
        * Affects BOTH and ONLY Bias and Variance  
    * __Dimensionality Reduction__:  
        * Decrease Variance (by simplifying models)  
    * __Feature Selection__:  
        * Decrease Variance (by simplifying models)  
    * __Regularization__:  
        * Increase Bias
        * Decrease Variance
    * __Increasing # of Hidden Units in ANNs__:  
        * Decrease Bias
        * Increase Variance  
    * __Increasing # of Hidden Layers in ANNs__:  
        * Decrease Bias  
        * Increase Variance  
    * __Increasing $$k$$ in K-NN__:  
        * Increase Bias
        * Decrease Variance  
    * __Increasing Depth in Decision-Trees__:  
        * Increase Variance  
    * __Boosting__:  
        * Decreases Bias  
    * __Bagging__:  
        * Reduces Variance              

    * We __Cannot Reduce__ the __Irreducible Err__  
            
            



7. **Application of the Decomposition to Classification:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    A similar decomposition exists for:  
    * Classification w/ $$0-1$$ loss  
    * Probabilistic Classification w/ Squared Error  

8. **Bias-Variance Decomposition and Risk (Excess Risk Decomposition):**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    The __Bias-Variance Decomposition__ analyzes the behavior of the *__Expected Risk/Generalization Error__* for any function $$\hat{f}$$:  
    <p>$$R(\hat{f}) = \mathrm{E}\left[(y-\hat{f}(x))^{2}\right]=(\operatorname{Bias}[\hat{f}(x)])^{2}+\operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}(x)]+\sigma^{2}$$</p>  
    Assuming that $$y = f(x) + \epsilon$$.  

    The __Bayes Optimal Predictor__ is $$f(x) = \mathrm{E}[Y\vert X=x]$$.  

    The __Excess Risk__ is:  
    <p>$$\text{ExcessRisk}(\hat{f}) = R(\hat{f}) - R(f)$$</p>  

    __Excess Risk Decomposition:__{: style="color: red"}  
    We add and subtract the __target function $$f_{\text{target}}=\inf_{h \in \mathcal{H}} I[h]$$__ that minimizes the __(true) expected risk__:  
    <p>$$\text{ExcessRisk}(\hat{f}) = \underbrace{\left(R(\hat{f}) - R(f_{\text{target}})\right)}_ {\text { estimation error }} + \underbrace{\left(R(f_{\text{target}}) - R(f)\right)}_ {\text { approximation error }}$$</p>  



    The __Bias-Variance Decomposition__ for *__Excess Risk:__*  
    * Re-Writing __Excess Risk__:  
        <p>$$\text{ExcessRisk}(\hat{f}) = R(\hat{f}) - R(f) = \mathrm{E}\left[(y-\hat{f}(x))^{2}\right] - \mathrm{E}\left[(y-f(x))^{2}\right]$$</p>  
        which is equal to:  
        <p>$$R(\hat{f}) - R(f) = \mathrm{E}\left[(f(x)-\hat{f}(x))^{2}\right]$$</p>  
    <p>$$\mathrm{E}\left[(f(x)-\hat{f}(x))^{2}\right] = (\operatorname{Bias}[\hat{f}(x)])^{2}+\operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}(x)]$$</p>  

    * if you dont want to mess with stat-jargon; lemme rephrase:  
        is the minimizer $${\displaystyle f=\inf_{h \in \mathcal{H}} I[h]}$$ where $$I[h]$$ is the expected-risk/generalization-error (assume MSE);  
        is it $$\overline{f}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbb{E}_ {\mathcal{D}}\left[f^{(\mathcal{D})}(\mathbf{x})\right]$$ the average hypothesis over all realizations of $$N$$ data-points $$\mathcal{D}_ i$$??

## Generalization Theory

* [Generalization Bounds: PAC-Bayes, Rademacher, ERM, etc. (Notes!)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall17/cos597A/lecnotes/generalize.pdf)  
* [Deep Learning Generalization (blog!)](http://www.offconvex.org/2017/12/08/generalization1/)  

1. **Generalization Theory:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    

    __Approaches to (Notions of) Quantitative Description of Generalization Theory:__{: style="color: red"}  
    * VC Dimension
    * Rademacher Complexity
    * PAC-Bayes Bound  



    __Prescriptive vs Descriptive Theory:__{: style="color: red"}  
    * __Prescriptive__: only attaches a label to the problem, without giving any insight into how to solve the problem.  
    * __Descriptive__: describes the problem in detail (e.g. by providing cause) and allows you to solve the problem.  

    Generalization Theory Notions consist of attaching a descriptive label to the basic phenomenon of lack of generalization. They are hard to compute for today’s complicated ML models, let alone to use as a guide in designing learning systems.  
    __Generalization Bounds as Descriptive Labels:__{: style="color: red"}  
    * __Rademacher Complexity__:  
        <button>Assumptions</button>{: .showText value="show" onclick="showText_withParent_PopHide(event);"}
        * labels and loss are 0,1,  
        * the badly generalizing $$h$$ predicts perfectly on the training sample $$S$$ and  
            is completely wrong on the heldout set $$S_2$$, meaning:  
            <p>$$\Delta_{S}(h)-\Delta_{S_{2}}(h) \approx-1$$</p>  
        {: hidden=""}
        


4. **Overfitting:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}
    One way to summarize __Overfitting__ is:  
    <span>discovering patterns in data that do not exist in the intended application</span>{: style="color: purple"}.  
    The typical case of overfitting "<span>decreasing loss only on the training set and increasing the loss on the validation set</span>{: style="color: purple"}" is only one example of this.  

    The question then is how we prevent overfitting from occurring.  
    The problem is that <span>we cannot know apriori what patterns will generalize from the dataset</span>{: style="color: purple"}.  


    __No-Free-Lunch (NFL) Theorem:__{: style="color: red"}  
    * __NFL Theorems for Supervised Machine Learning:__  
        * In his 1996 paper The Lack of A Priori Distinctions Between Learning Algorithms, David Wolpert examines if it is possible to get useful theoretical results with a training data set and a learning algorithm without making any assumptions about the target variable.  
        * _Wolpert_ proves that given a noise-free data set (i.e. no random variation, only trend) and a machine learning algorithm where the cost function is the error rate, all machine learning algorithms are equivalent when assessed with a generalization error rate (the model’s error rate on a validation data set).  
        * Extending this logic he demonstrates that for any two algorithms, A and B, there are as many scenarios where A will perform worse than B as there are where A will outperform B. This even holds true when one of the given algorithms is random guessing.  
        * This is because nearly all (non-rote) machine learning algorithms make some assumptions (known as inductive or learning bias) about the relationships between the predictor and target variables, introducing bias into the model.  
            The assumptions made by machine learning algorithms mean that some algorithms will fit certain data sets better than others. It also (by definition) means that there will be as many data sets that a given algorithm will not be able to model effectively.  
            How effective a model will be is directly dependent on how well the assumptions made by the model fit the true nature of the data.  
        * Implication: you can’t get good machine learning “for free”.  
            You must use knowledge about your data and the context of the world we live in (or the world your data lives in) to select an appropriate machine learning model.  
            There is no such thing as a single, universally-best machine learning algorithm, and there are no context or usage-independent (a priori) reasons to favor one algorithm over all others.  
    * __NFL Theorem for Search/Optimization:__  
        * All algorithms that search for an extremum of a cost function perform exactly the same when averaged over all possible cost functions. So, for any search/optimization algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in performance over another class.  
        * It state that any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.    
        * Wolpert and McReady essentially say that <span>you need some prior knowledge that is encoded in your algorithm in order to search well</span>{: style="color: purple"}.  
            They created the theorem to give an easy counter example to researchers that would create a (tweak on an) algorithm and claimed that it would work better on all possible problems. It can’t. There’s a proof. If you have a good algorithm, it must in some way fit on your problem space, and you will have to investigate how.  
    * <button>__Explanation through a thought experiment:__</button>{: .showText value="show" onclick="showText_withParent_PopHide(event);"}
        * Suppose you see someone toss a coin and get heads. What is the probability distribution over the next result of the coin toss?  
            Did you think heads 50% and tails 50%?  
            If so, you’re wrong: the answer is that we don’t know.  
            For all we know, the coin could have heads on both sides. Or, it might even obey some strange laws of physics and come out as tails every second toss.  
            The point is, <span>there is no way we can extract only patterns that will __generalize__</span>{: style="color: purple"}: there will always be some scenarios where those patterns will not exist.  
            This is the essence of what is called the __No Free Lunch Theorem__: <span>any model that you create will always “overfit” and be completely wrong in some scenarios</span>{: style="color: purple"}.  
        {: hidden=""}  
    * __Main Concept:__ Generalizing is extrapolating to new data. To do that you need to make assumptions and for problems where the assumptions don’t hold you will be suboptimal.  
    * __Practical Implications__:  
        * Bias-free learning is futile because a learner that makes no a priori assumptions will have no rational basis for creating estimates when provided new, unseen input data.  
            Models are simplifications of a specific component of reality (observed with data). To simplify reality, a machine learning algorithm or statistical model needs to make assumptions and introduce bias (known specifically as inductive or learning bias).  
            The assumptions of an algorithm will work for some data sets but fail for others.  
        * This shows that we need some restriction on $$\mathcal{H}$$ even for the realizable PAC setting. We cannot learn arbitrary set of hypothesis, there is no free lunch.  
        * There is no universal (one that works for all $$\mathcal{H}$$) learning algorithm.  
            I.e., if the algorithm $$A$$ has no idea about $$\mathcal{H},$$ even the singleton hypothesis class $$\mathcal{H}=\{h\}$$ (as in the statement of the theorem) is not PAC learnable.  
        * Why do we have to fix a hypothesis class when coming up with a learning algorithm? Can we _"just learn"_?  
            The NFL theorem formally shows that the answer is __NO__.  
        * Counter the following claim: "My machine learning algorithm/optimization strategy is the best, always and forever, for all the scenarios".  
        * Always check your assumptions before relying on a model or search algorithm.  
        * There is no “super algorithm” that will work perfectly for all datasets.  
        * Variable length and redundant encodings are not covered by the NFL theorems. Does Genetic Programming get a pass?  
        * NFL theorems are like a statistician sitting with his head in the fridge, and his feet in the oven. On average, his temperature is okay! NFL theorems prove that the arithmetic mean of performance is constant over all problems, it doesn’t prove that for other statistics this is the case. There has been an interesting ‘counter’ proof, where a researcher proved that for a particular problem space, a hill-climber would outperform a hill-descender on 90% of the problem instances, and did that by virtue of being exponentially worse on the remaining 10% of the problems. Its average performance abided by the NFL theorem and the two algorithms were equal when looking at mean performance, yet the hill-climber was better in 90% of the problems, i.e., it had a much better median performance. So is there maybe a free appetizer?  
        * While no one model/algorithm works best for every problem, it may be that one model/algorithm works best for all real-world problems, or all problems that we care about, practically speaking.
